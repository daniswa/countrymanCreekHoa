                            <br>
                            <p class='bodyText'>On behalf of the Homeowners Association, I would like to take this opportunity to 
                            welcome you as a member of our community.</p>
                            <p class='bodyText'>The Homeowners Association functions in accordance with the Covenants, Conditions, & 
                            Restrictions and Bylaws, which can be found on our website at www.countrymancreekhoa.com. We have an annual 
                            members meeting that is typically held the first Saturday in May at the Columbus Fire Hall. We have a 
                            five-member board that is elected by the membership, with a President, Vice-President, Secretary, Treasurer 
                            and Member-at-Large. Our association fiscal year runs from May through April. Currently the annual assessment 
                            (2016-2017) is $159.13 per tract, for which you should receive an invoice at the beginning of the association 
                            fiscal year. Assessments are due by the date of the annual meeting each year. Dues increase 3% each year. 
                            The following are some of the highlights of association information that you may find helpful:</p>
                            <p class='bodyTextList'>1.) The association currently maintains two community wells for members to draw 
                            non-potable water for firefighting protection.</p>
                            <p class='bodyTextList'>2.) The association maintains a snowplow vehicle with a sander attachment for 
                            plowing/sanding the ranch road network as necessary. Snow plowing is NOT an association obligation. The 
                            snowplow vehicle is available for members in good standing to use to plow private roads and driveways. 
                            If you are interested in assisting with plowing please contact a board member.</p>
                            <p class='bodyTextList'>3.) Building plans should be submitted prior to the beginning of any building 
                            project and the HOA Board has 30 days to respond.  If the Board does not respond within 30 days the building 
                            project can proceed.</p>
                            <p class='bodyTextList'>4.) The HOA board is made up of Volunteers.  Please have patience as the board works 
                            toward the improvement of the HOA.</p>
                            <p class='bodyText'>Current Board Members are: Tom Kessler (President) 406-780-0564, Vince Slevira 
                            (Vice-President) 406-780-0557, Jennifer Kessler (Secretary) 406-780-0745, Cheryl Slevira (member-at large) 
                            406-321-0098.</p>
                            <p class='bodyText'>Please take the time to contact a board member, or send us your contact information so
